    "# Correlation, Regression and Multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you'll practice some of the concepts from the previous lesson and begin to investigate multicollinearity in your data. **Multicollinearity is when features in your X space have correlation with each other.**  This can lead to some interesting problems in regression where it is difficult to determine precise coefficient weights for the various features. The general idea is that with the highly correlated features, you can get nearly identical performance with different combinations of those correlated features; 1 of this and 1 of that, 2 of this and none of that, 1.5 of this and .5 of that, 50 of this and -48 of that all would produce the same result if our two features are perfectly correlated.\n",

We have a bizarre dataset recording ice cream sales and shark attacks on given days at various beach towns, and plotting the two we notice a distinct correlation between the two. This does not mean that more ice sales causes more shark attacks to happen. In this case, both variables (ice cream sales and shark attacks) are correlated with a third feature we have yet to examine: temperature. In summer, as the temperature rises, both ice cream sales and shark attacks increase while in winter, there are comparitively few of both.

That could be the anticipated number of votes for a candidate, the gross sales for a product, the value of a home, or the number of yelp review for a restaurant. If you're trying to predict a numerical value, you'll want to use a regression algorithm. You may have seen simple linear regression in a previous class. This type of regression is known as ordinary least squares; it determines a line of best fit by minimizing the sum of squares of the errors between the models predictions and the actual data. In algebra and statistics classes, this is often limited to the simple 2 variable case of y=mx+b, but this process can be generalized to use multiple predictive variables. While there can be a lot of underlying mathematics, Python and SKlearn make generating and tuning these models incredibly straightforward. Here's a general outline:  \n",

    "There are a few considerations to keep in mind when it comes to interpreting regression models based on underlying data with multicollinearity. *One is that the coefficients in the model themselves lose interpretability.* Under ideal conditions, we would like to interpret our coefficients literally. For example, the coefficient associated with temperature is 38.49. If this coefficient were stable, we could say something along the lines \"as a the temperature goes up by 1, the weekly sales goes up by 38.49. Unfortunately, with multicollinearity, we cannot make such claims. That is because the coefficients associated with weights that are highly correlated may vary widely. For example, observe what happens to the coefficients when we remove a feature with correlation to others:"

    "What this goes to demonstrate is that some of these coefficients are unstable and depend on what other features are incorporated into the model. Adding additional features that are correlated with features already added will never reduce the overall performance of the model, but can be thought of as 'not adding much new information'. In this way, adding correlated features is unlikely to drastically increase model performance to any substantial degree. This also makes it difficult to judge the importance of a particular variable; the importance of the variable depends on what variables are already present (if other variables already exist which are highly correlated, then the variable will again add little predictive information)."

    "Another huge problem with our current model is the data we have fed into it. Specifically, we passed two columns, Store and department which were numeric, but are really more of categorical variables then quantities on a discrete or continuous scale. For example, store 2 and store 1 aren't really numeric quantities, they are simply labels designating which store A or B, we are talking about. The proper way to encode this data is as binary flags (0 or 1) designating 'Is_This_Store_A?' and 'Is_This_Store_B'. This will lead to a large number of new columns, one for each possible value that a categorical variable would take on. For example, we have 45 stores in our dataset, so this will require 45 new columns, one for each store. Each of these columns will then have a binary variable (0 or 1) that will indicate whether that particular data point is associated with that particular store. While this may sound like a lot of tedious work in practice, pandas has a useful built in feature called **get_dummies()** which makes this process easy."
